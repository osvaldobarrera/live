# Peek.fm: A Friend Explorer for Last.fm 
This is a fork of [Jakeledoux's Last.fm Live](https://github.com/jakeledoux/live). The goal of this fork is to create a totally portable and client-side version of said web app, and tweak it so it can serve as a companion to [ListenAlongJS](https://github.com/osvaldobarrera/ListenAlongJS). Right now, the improvements are:

* A PHP server is no longer needed.
* Save any visible username to the clipboard.
* Go deeper and explore the friends of your friends. 

# License
The original source code didn't have any declared license, so I decided to leave this little project for personal use only. That changed. Jakeledoux gave me [his permission](https://archive.is/69CeH) to make a derivative work and distribute it.

I decided to distribute this derivative work with a AGPL license. You can copy this program, modify it, and redistribute it for commercial use, among other uses, as long as you
* make your own modified code publicly available, 
* state what you changed, 
* give credit to previous authors.
